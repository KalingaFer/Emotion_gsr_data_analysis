# Overview

human emotions and how neuromarketing, a field that combines neuroscience with
marketing research, helps analyse emotional responses to various media. It introduces
iMotions, a platform integrating sensor data for research purposes, enabling studies such as
eye tracking and GSR analysis. Eye-tracking studies focus on user behaviour during website
navigation, while GSR studies examine emotional responses to images. Python is suggested as
an alternative tool for analysis. The project aims to merge traditional methods with iMotions'
processes to create a hybrid system for conducting studies. The methodology involves
reviewing and improving previous work on both eye tracking and GSR studies and comparing
them with iMotions' results.
